# FluidChain

## What?

This is a Python library for chaining together FluCoMa processes.

## Setup

`git clone` this repo and `cd` to it.

`FluidChain` is a Python module and so you need to install it to a virtual environment or elsewhere.
I would recommend just installing it globally with `pip3 install -e FluidChain`

## How?

There is an example usage in this repo. The concept is quite simple and revolves around creating various 'links' and then chaining them together by adding them to an instance of the `Chain()` class.
